Welcome to my personal website.

### Fun Fact:

I¡¯ve found that many people who don¡¯t speak Chinese have a hard time pronouncing my first name **'Yuxuan'** correctly, because the pronunciation of 'Y' and 'X' in Chinese is distinct from English. Generally, a good English approximation would be **'Yoo-Shyooan'** where **'Yoo'** has a falling tone while **'Shyooan'** has a rising tone. To avoid situations where you say  and I don¡¯t realize you¡¯re talking to me, you can call me by my English name, **Johan**, or click on this [Chinese name website](https://www.namechef.co/chinese-name/details/%E7%85%9C%E8%BB%92/) to see fun facts about my name
